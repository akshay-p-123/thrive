Application for 2023-2024 FBLA Mobile App Development

Teenagers nowadays are becoming increasingly involved in the professional world. As such, a dedicated venue for them to network and share their qualifications is vital for their success. Thrive achieves that purpose by allowing students to put their extracurricular participation, coursework, volunteer experience, and more, on full display through a highly intuitive UI/UX. LinkedIn is a potent tool for networking, but it is geared towards adults with decades of work experience. Thrive lowers the barrier to entry for teenagers and allows them to showcase experiences specific to them, like honors classes and athletic participation. 

### Technologies and Features
The front end of Thrive is being built with **React Native** because of its ease of use and compatibility with the npm package manager. **Expo** is used to streamline the process of testing and creating builds.

The backend of Thrive is built on **Firebase** because it is the most established and well-documented managed backend. Thrive takes advantage of **Firebase Auth**, **Firestore Realtime Database**, and **Firebase Cloud Storage**

Currently, no business layer is required, but if necessary, we will use **Redux** to manage the state of Thrive.

Thrive features the ability to log in with email, Google, and LinkedIn and functions on iOS and Android phones.

Currently, all profile setup needs to be done manually, but in the future, we will add the capability to import information from LinkedIn. We will also add the ability to view others' profiles and incorporate a messaging system.
